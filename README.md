The team selected three problems presented in (HILLIER &amp; LIEBERMAN, 2013), formulated them as linear optimization problems, establishing a mathematical model in terms of an objective function, decision variables and constraints, and solved them by applying methods of three distinct solvers: CPLEX (v.20.1.0.0), GUROBI (v. 9.1.2), which are among the main commercial solvers, and GLPK (v. 4.65), one of the most popular open-source solvers (free software) today. For thar purpose, the Python programming language (v.3.7.1) was used with the PuLP modeling library (v2.4).
